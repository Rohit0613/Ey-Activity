# Cloud Service Models: IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

Cloud computing provides services in different layers. The three most common models are:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

Each model balances **control, responsibility, cost, and ease of use** differently.

## üåê IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- **Definition**: Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking) over the internet.
- **Target Users**: System admins, IT teams, developers.
- **Provider Responsibility**: Hardware, virtualization, storage, networking.
- **User Responsibility**: Operating system, middleware, runtime, data, applications.
- **Customization**: High ‚Äî full control over environment.
- **Scalability**: High ‚Äî user manages scaling.
- **Setup Time**: Long ‚Äî requires manual configuration.
- **Maintenance**: Handled by the user (patching OS, updates, security configs).
- **Cost Model**: Pay-as-you-go (resources billed based on usage).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hosting websites and applications
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Testing and development environments
- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- **Definition**: Provides a platform (hardware + software tools) for building and deploying applications.
- **Target Users**: Developers.
- **Provider Responsibility**: Hardware, OS, middleware, runtime.
- **User Responsibility**: Applications and data.
- **Customization**: Moderate ‚Äî control limited to application logic.
- **Scalability**: High ‚Äî built-in scaling tools provided.
- **Setup Time**: Moderate ‚Äî platform setup required.
- **Maintenance**: Shared between provider and user.
- **Cost Model**: Pay for platform usage.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Building web apps and APIs
  - Deploying microservices
  - Mobile backend services
- **Examples**: Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## üíª SaaS (Software as a Service)
- **Definition**: Fully functional applications delivered over the internet, ready to use.
- **Target Users**: End users and businesses.
- **Provider Responsibility**: Everything ‚Äî infrastructure, platform, and software.
- **User Responsibility**: Just uses the software (minimal configuration).
- **Customization**: Low ‚Äî limited to in-app settings.
- **Scalability**: High ‚Äî handled by provider.
- **Setup Time**: Very short ‚Äî ready to use instantly.
- **Maintenance**: 100% handled by provider.
- **Cost Model**: Subscription-based (monthly or yearly licensing).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Email and collaboration tools
  - CRM and ERP software
  - Cloud storage and file sharing
- **Examples**: Gmail, Salesforce, Dropbox, Microsoft 365.
