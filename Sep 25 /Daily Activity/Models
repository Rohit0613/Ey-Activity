1. Linear Regression
- Definition Predicts a continuous value based on input features using a straight-line relationship.
- Use Case Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.
- Example Predicting salary based on years of experience.

2. Logistic Regression
- Definition Predicts a binary outcome (yesno, truefalse) using a sigmoid function.
- Use Case Email spam detection.
- Example Predicting whether a customer will buy a product (1) or not (0).

3. Decision Tree
- Definition A tree-like model that splits data based on feature values to make decisions.
- Use Case Loan approval systems.
- Example If income  ₹50K and credit score  700 → approve loan.

 4. Random Forest
- Definition An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
- Use Case Disease diagnosis from medical data.
- Example Predicting diabetes based on multiple health indicators.

5. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Definition Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes.
- Use Case Face detection in images.
- Example Classifying images as cat vs. dog.

 6. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Definition Deep learning model specialized for image and spatial data.
- Use Case Medical image analysis (e.g., detecting tumors).
- Example Classifying handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).

 7. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Definition Neural network for sequential data with memory of previous inputs.
- Use Case Language modeling and text generation.
- Example Predicting the next word in a sentence.

 8. Transformers
- Definition Deep learning architecture using attention mechanisms for sequence modeling.
- Use Case Machine translation (e.g., English to Hindi).
- Example ChatGPT and BERT use transformers.

9. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- Definition Two neural networks (generator and discriminator) compete to create realistic data.
- Use Case Generating realistic images or art.
- Example Creating fake celebrity faces.

10. Diffusion Models
- Definition Generate data by reversing a noise process, often used in image synthesis.
- Use Case AI art generation (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion).
- Example Creating a painting from a text prompt.

11. LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Definition Deep learning models trained on massive text data to understand and generate language.
- Use Case Chatbots, code generation, summarization.
- Example ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude.
